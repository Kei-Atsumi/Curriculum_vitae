In my childhood I wanted to be a shark taxonomist that would allow me to see various kinds of fishes and roam across the world. Yet, in doing undergraduate study I faced lot of difficulty to do so and I became more interested in evolutionary biology.

In the PhD course at Hokkaido University, Japan, I decided to work on [freshwater fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribolodon) to investigate *how female ornamentation works and why interspecific mating happens*. While I did behavioral *experiment/field survey/*[*citizen science*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11284-017-1466-z) for the fish, I also conducted *meta-analysis* to uncover general pattens of [*F1 hybrids' phenotypic distribution*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.14224). 

In the late years of my PhD I became interested in ecology as well. To understand how the strength of predator-prey interaction between larvae of salamander and frog are determined, I did lots of experiments (sadly they are [not published yet](https://ecoevorxiv.org/uz7rj/)). 

On 2021, thanks to [JSPS](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html), I got a chance to be a postdoc at the United States/Italy. However, due to covid-19 pandemic, I could not move to US and start the planned study. During the desperate period, I became interested in connecting evolutionary biology/ecology to society/economy because I watched [NIKKEI TV](https://www.bs-tvtokyo.co.jp/plus10/) everyday. 

Now I came back to Japan and became a data scientist at a startup company [Biome Inc.](https://biome.co.jp/). While I keep my interest in evolutionary biology/ecology, I set *connecting biology with society through citizen science* as one of my career goals.
